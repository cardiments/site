        Practice these rudiments at varying tempos and note subdivision values. Slow, controlled practice will lead to
        better practice and faster tempos over time

        Practice rudiments leading with both hands. Some rudiments naturally “flip” leading hands in their pattern.
        Rudiments where the leading hand “sticks” should be practiced with the alternative sticking too.

        * IMG Hands

        Cardiments can be used alongside other learning methods. Taking lessons from a good drum teacher is invaluable
        to the development of your own style and sound.
