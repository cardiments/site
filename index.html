          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Cardiments id the brainchild of a UK drummer Jack. 
            Jack decided to get good at drums using rudiments. 
            He found drumming text books and full score notation 
            a bit daunting. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Jack decided to make his own flash cards to memorise rudiments. 
            Realising the 26 standard rudiments published by NARD 
            fitted on 2 suits in a deck of playing cards this got him thinking
            One thing led to another and several months later cardiments was born!
